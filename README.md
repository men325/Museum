# Museum
The "Museum" software system is an application that will allow the user to choose museum tours and sign up for them. The user will be able to find out about the halls in which the tour takes place, which exhibits will be seen and who will be the guide. Also, the application will allow the administrator to add,
delete and change information about excursions.

The project is a full-fledged museum system with an individually developed method of data storage. According to the architecture layer, the following technologies were used: the first layer of the user interface was developed using JSP technology; the second layer â€“ the business logic layer is written using Java Servlet; the third layer - the level of access to the database was made using ORM technology,
namely the use of the Hibernate library. The database layer itself was developed on MySQL.

Here is logical scheme of database:
